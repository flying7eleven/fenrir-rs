Fenrir (_Fenrir was the son of the trickster god Loki and the giantess AngrboÃ°a_) facilitates collecting and shipping your applications logs to a [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) instance.
It does this by integrating with the log crate.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for several use-cases, check out the [examples folder](https://github.com/flying7eleven/fenrir-rs/tree/main/examples).

1. Create a new Rust project: `cargo new example`
2. Add dependencies to this create to your **Cargo.toml** file:

    ```toml
    [dependencies.fenrir-rs]
    version = "0.5.0"
    features = ["ureq", "json"]
    ```

3. Use it ðŸ˜‰

## Development and testing
For easier testing and during the development phase, you can use the example docker-compose.yml to start your own instance of Loki locally.
Just use `docker compose` to start the Loki container as well as a local Grafana instance for viewing the messages:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

After the containers have started, you can visit [http://localhost:3000/explore](http://localhost:3000/explore) to query messages in your local Loki instance.
